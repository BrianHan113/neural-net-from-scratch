# neural-net-from-scratch

### Description

Feed-forward neural network made in Python from scratch without using any external libraries (except numpy for math, and keras for loading MNIST dataset). Used to train a model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, but designed to be generic, and adaptable to different requirements and datasets. Achieved an 88% test accuracy in 15 minutes of playing around with hyper-parameters.
